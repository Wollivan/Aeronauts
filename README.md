Squadron Leader is a fast-pace World War 1 (loosely) themed aerial combat game that is easy to learn and quick to play, with multifaceted strategy built-in that can be enjoyed by all ages!

The modular nature of the rules allows for players to customise their game and add entirely new layers of strategy.

We encourage the use of house rules, and if you think your rule improves the game, make a suggestion on <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!
