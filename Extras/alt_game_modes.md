# Alternative Game modes

## Team game

You can change the feel of the game greatly by flying with a wingman. The strategy of how you fly together is totally up to you. Here are the additional rules for playing in teams:

- Teammates should sit next to one another.
- The playing order is determined by teams, rather than players, so within your team you decide who moves first, and once the entire team has moved, the other team goes. This is the same principle for attacking.

## Quick game

There are a few ways to make the game shorter:

- Have everyone start with a max of 2 Health.
- Designate a smaller playing area.
- Allow players to gain more than 1 altitude per round.

Feel free to experiment with the starting numbers, the original 4,3,3,2 is a guideline for balanced games, so going higher will change the game. As long as each player has the same choices it SHOULD be fair.

## Hex Grid Mode (for players without a 3D printer)

The game can be played on a hex grid. That removes the need for manoeuvre templates and range rulers. All rules are the same as without a grid, except for what is described in this section.

Any battlemat with a hex grid can be used. Planes set up in hexes along each player's edge of the mat. There can only ever be one plane per hex, and planes can never end a manoeuvre in the same hex as another plane. A plane always face one of the six sides of its hex.

Instead of using the manoeuvre templates there are three possible manoeuvres on a hex grid that are used instead:

- 1 (Cost 1) Move 2 hexes forward.
- 2 (Cost 2) Move 1 hex forward, then turn left or right 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward in the new direction.
- 3 (Cost 3) Turn 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward, then turn another 60 degrees in the same direction as the first turn

Attacks are up to range 3. Count range in hexes, not including the hex occupied by the attacking plane, but including the attacked plane. The firing arc of a plane is a cone in front of it, starting with the single hex in front, then the 3 hexes in front of that, then the 5 beyond those.

The hexes immediately in front of the firing plane corresponds to the closest section of the range ruler for the purpose of attack bonuses. Hexes at range 3 corresponds to the furthest section of the range ruler.
