It's no secret that Squadron Leader was partially inspired by X-Wing TMG, so it stands to reason that there should be a way to use pieces from that amazing game to Sqquadron Leader.

Now you can with this new expansion!

There is a token for small bases using the 3mm peg, and large bases using the bomber token and space for the 6mm peg.
