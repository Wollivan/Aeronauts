# Advanced Rules

These rules are for players already familiar with the core rules, or those who want to dive right in and become world famous fighter pilots!

## Split S

This rule prevents a pilot from being stuck when they are being tailed by an opponent.

- The Split S costs 4 altitude to execute.
- Turn the plane token 180° at the end of the manoeuvre.
- Players cannot perform a Split S and gain altitude in the same round.

You can read more about the Split S manoeuvre here:

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_S" target="_blank" class="button">Split S Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"To execute a split S, the pilot half-rolls their aircraft inverted and executes a descending half-loop, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude."

## Immelmann

This rule rewards aggressive tactics.

- This is an optionaly manoeuvre that can only be performed immediatley after reducing another opponent's Health to 0.
- Do the following actions in order:
  - Gain 3 altitude tokens
  - Execute a straight
  - Place your plane token at 180° at the end of the manoeuvre (facing the opposite direction to the way they were).

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immelmann_turn" target="_blank" class="button">Immelmann Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"In modern aerobatics, an Immelmann turn (also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic manoeuvre that results in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude."

Thanks to Ben for teaching me that this manoeuvre has a name, and thanks Josh for finding Split S so that what the rules do in game match what real life planes can do!

## Barrel Roll

This rule seperates the timid from the bold!

- During the manoeuvre phase a player may declare they are executing a Barrel Roll and execute either the 2 or 3 cost manoeuvre, but instead of orienting their plane along the new axis, their token will not rotate at all, and be traveling in the same direction.
- The manoeuvre cost is double the cost of whichever manoeuvre template the player is using (the straight now costs 2, the bank now costs 4).
- Players cannot perform a Barrel roll and gain altitude in the same round.

You can read more about the Barrel roll manoeuvre here:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_roll" target="_blank" class="button">Barrel Roll Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"A barrel roll is an aerial manoeuvre in which an airplane makes a complete rotation on both its longitudinal and lateral axes, causing it to follow a helical path, approximately maintaining its original direction."

## Dive Bomb

After a players has attacked, if the defender is within range one **and** the attacker has at least 2 more altitude than the defender, they may attempt to perform a dive bomb manoeuvre:

- Remove altitude tokens from the attacker until they have the same number as the defender
- The attacker rolls a d6:
  - On a 2-6 result the defender suffers 1 damage
  - On a 1 result the attacker suffers 1 damage

You can read more about the Dive Bomb manoeuvre here:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_bomber" target="_blank" class="button">Immelmann Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:
"A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives directly at its targets in order to provide greater accuracy for the bomb it drops. Diving towards the target simplifies the bomb's trajectory and allows the pilot to keep visual contact throughout the bomb run."

Not to be confused with the Divebomb, the homicidal Decepticon.

## Ace Pilot

Earn your wings and keep the action moving!

- When a pilot destroys another plane, they become the Ace.
- For as long as they are the Ace, that pilot may reroll 1 Attack dice and 1 Defense dice each round.
- There can only be one Ace in the sky at a time.

## Alternative Game modes

### Team game

You can change the feel of the game greatly by flying with a wingman. The strategy of how you fly together is totally up to you. Here are the additional rules for playing in teams:

- Teammates should sit next to one another.
- The playing order is determined by teams, rather than players, so within your team you decide who moves first, and once the entire team has moved, the other team goes. This is the same principle for attacking.

### Quick game

There are a few ways to make the game shorter:

- Have everyone start with a max of 2 Health.
- Designate a smaller playing area.
- Allow players to gain more than 1 altitude per round.

Feel free to experiment with the starting numbers, the original 4,3,3,2 is a guideline for balanced games, so going higher will change the game. As long as each player has the same choices it SHOULD be fair.

### Hex Grid Mode (for players without a 3D printer)

The game can be played on a hex grid. That removes the need for manoeuvre templates and range rulers. All rules are the same as without a grid, except for what is described in this section.

Any battlemat with a hex grid can be used. Planes set up in hexes along each player's edge of the mat. There can only ever be one plane per hex, and planes can never end a manoeuvre in the same hex as another plane. A plane always face one of the six sides of its hex.

Instead of using the manoeuvre templates there are three possible manoeuvres on a hex grid that are used instead:

- 1 (Cost 1) Move 2 hexes forward.
- 2 (Cost 2) Move 1 hex forward, then turn left or right 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward in the new direction.
- 3 (Cost 3) Turn 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward, then turn another 60 degrees in the same direction as the first turn

![hex_moves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91621088/167960079-7a060dfd-bdcc-4787-87df-f362fb33d053.png)

Attacks are up to range 3. Count range in hexes, not including the hex occupied by the attacking plane, but including the attacked plane. The firing arc of a plane is a cone in front of it, starting with the single hex in front, then the 3 hexes in front of that, then the 5 beyond those.

The hexes immediately in front of the firing plane corresponds to the closest section of the range ruler for the purpose of attack bonuses. Hexes at range 3 corresponds to the furthest section of the range ruler.
