# Printable Rulebook for Squadron Leader

This page can be found at [sl-rulebook.wollivan.dev](https://sl-rulebook.wollivan.dev), or run locally.
It will give you a quick referece rules PDF to print out.

The reason there isn't a PDF saved here, is because the rules may change, and it saves whoever makes the change from having to regenerate the PDF.

Originally the rulebook site was run from a separate repo, but that felt wrong, so here it is to go with the rest of the Open Source goodness that is Squadron Leader.
