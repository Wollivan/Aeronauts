# Bombers & Balloons

![bombers-and-balloons-assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/main/Expansions/Bombers_and_Balloons/bombers_and_balloons.png)

This expansion adds 2 new game pieces to the game, and you guessed them:

Bombers and Balloons!
(and a surprise third, the Bomb token)

## Bombers

Bombers use a larger token that can be found <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/tree/main/Expansions/BombersAndBallons/STLs" target="_blank">here</a>. They use the same manoeuvre template as the other planes, making use of the extranious pieces at the front and back of the token.

Here are the special rules for the Bomber token:

- Instead of having the stats 4,3,3,2 to assign, they have 4,4,2,2
- Bombers are slower so their Manoeuvrability must be 2
- Bombers may only spend 1 altitude when they dive
- The bomber can fire in a 360Â° arc if the enemy is within range 1-2 (forward arc is range 3)
- The bomber can "Drop Bombs"

### Dropping Bombs

At the end on their manoeuvre, the bomber may Drop a Bomb, by placing the bomb token at the other end of the template they just used for their manoeuvre.

Excluding the turn it was dropped, if any player is within range 1 of the bomb at the end the round, they roll 4 attack dice and takes 1 damage on all 4-6 results.

## Balloons

Balloons are a stationary object placed in the playing area before the game starts. Balloons are placed **before** planes.

During the game, if a player comes within range 1 of the balloon, that player immediatley rolls 4 attack dice and takes 1 damage on all 4-6 results.

It is up to the players to decide how many balloons each player may place before the game starts. They can be placed in any area the player chooses. Players take turns placing Balloons.

## Missions

There are some scenarios for players to use with their Bombers and balloons, and they can be found here:

## Cover

Bombers and Balloons both have one major thing in common... they are big!

If an attacker is shooting a target (any kind of target) they **roll 1 less dice** and **may not re-roll** any of their dice for this attack.
