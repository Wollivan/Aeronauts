# Getting a Copy of the Game

At the moment the only way to get a copy of this game is to make it yourself, or find a friend with a 3D printer who is willing to print it for you. In the future there may be a way to order them, or even a crowd funding thing... who knows!

There are only 4 assets that need to be printed.

- Plane and altitude tokens
- Stat board
- Manoeuvre template
- Range ruler

## Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/tree/main/3DPrinting/STLs" target="_blank">STLs</a> directory:

### For each player:

- player.stl
- stat_board.stl

### To share:

- manoeuvre_template.stl
- range_ruler.stl
- box.stl

### Optional fancy box topper:

FancyBoxTopper.stl is glued onto FancyBoxTop.stl. The topper is 'divided' into 5 levels to be able to perform filament swaps of different colours. The bottom level of the topper is .6mm giving 3, .2mm layer passes. All other levels are .4mm allowing 2, .2mm layer passes.

- If you are having a large dogfight and don't have enough different colour filaments, you can print the stat boards from the "extras" folder which have identifying letters".

### Rules Quick Reference Cards

There are 4 cards that have a quick reference for the basic and advanced rules. You can find them <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/tree/main/3DPrinting/STLs" target="_blank">here</a>.
The size is made to fit on standard business cards so you can get them printed double sided and only need to put 2 cards in a box.

## Downloads

You can download all the printable assets from GitHub. We aren't on any STL sharing sites because they don't allow continuous development with a GitHub repo, so this is the only place you can find us!

The game was originally designed to fit in old tobacco tins, so it is joyful to see copies of this in old tins!
