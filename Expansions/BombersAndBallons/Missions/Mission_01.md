# Mission 01 - The Errant Balloons

There are an unusual amount of Balloons in the area, I wonder if anyone is going to do anything about it!

## Game Piece Requirements

This misson requires:

- 3 Balloons
- 4 Planes

## Set up

One player will take all the Balloons and place them anywhere at least 1 range away from the edge of the play area.

Each player must place their tokens touching opposite sides of the play area to one another.
They start with 2 Planes each.

The player who placed the Balloons has an infinite supply of Planes. Every time one of their Planes are knocked out, wait 1 full round, then place the Plane back on the board anywhere along the edge the player originally started from.

## Objectives

The player who placed the Balloons must defend them at all costs!

The other player must destroy them... at any cost!

To destroy the Ballon, the player must attack them during the Attack Stage, and needs to make an attack with 2 hits.
A single hit on two consecutive turns won't cut it, it must be a double hit!

## Victory Requirements

The player who placed the Balloons wins if they destroy all enemy Planes.

The attacking player wins if they destroy all the Balloosn.
