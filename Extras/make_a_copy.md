# Getting a Copy of the Game

If you have a working 3D printer, you have all you need to make a copy of the game!
If you DON'T have a printer, we do, so you can [get a copy here](https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/buy-a-copy).

There are only 3 assets that **need** to be printed.

- Plane and altitude tokens
- Manoeuvre template
- Range ruler

## Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/tree/main/3DPrinting/STLs" target="_blank">STLs</a> directory:

### For each player:

- player.stl
- stat_board.stl
- life_tracker/wheel.stl

### To share:

- manoeuvre_template.stl
- range_ruler.stl
- box.stl (box_small.stl if you **aren't** printing the stat wheels)

### Optional Stat Trackers

If you don't want to use the <a href="https://planes.wollivan.dev/" target="_blank">online stat tracker</a>, you can print the Stat Wheel so each player can quickly reference their stats and health.

For each player, print:

- stat_wheels.stl
- stat_side.stl x2
- stat_axel.stl

**Tip:** Flip one of the stat_side's, so the finish on each end of the final wheel is the same.

### Optional fancy box topper:

FancyBoxTopper.stl is glued onto FancyBoxTop.stl. The topper is 'divided' into 5 levels to be able to perform filament swaps of different colours. The bottom level of the topper is .6mm giving 3, .2mm layer passes. All other levels are .4mm allowing 2, .2mm layer passes.

- If you are having a large dogfight and don't have enough different colour filaments, you can print the stat boards from the "extras" folder which have identifying letters".

### Rules Quick Reference Cards

There are 2 images that, when printed back to back, create a trifold quick reference rules book. You can find them <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/tree/main/3DPrinting/STLs" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Downloads

You can download all the printable assets from GitHub. We aren't on any STL sharing sites because they don't allow continuous development with a GitHub repo, so this is the only place you can find us!

The game was originally designed to fit in old tobacco tins, so it is joyful to see copies of this in old tins!
If you want a classic Squadron Leader tobacco tin without getting out a small loan <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/273646926/all-reserved-vintage-squadron-leader?show_sold_out_detail=1&ref=nla_listing_details" target="_blank">you can get an imitation here</a>.
